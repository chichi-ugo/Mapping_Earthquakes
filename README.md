# Mapping_Earthquakes
Using JavaScript and GeoJSON data to create dynamic maps

## Purpose
The goal of this project was to map earthquake GeoJSON data using JavaScript (JS) and APIs. In this project, we successfully made API requests from a host server and retreived data from GeoJSON files to create geographical maps with JS and the D3 library.

## Results
### Overlays and Legend
In the top right-hand corner of the screen for the map, the user is able to toggle between the different views for the map as well as add or deselct the given overlays - so that they can control what data is shown on the map. In the bottom right-hand corner is the legend that details the color distinction based on the different magnitudes of the earthquakes.
